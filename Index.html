                <p class="paragraphText">
                    As a psychologist, I always think at the first place about the end-users, which will use app or
                    other product.
                    </br>
                    I think that design is something more than beautiful- it must be useful and easy.
                    </br>
                    It’s perfect, when we can connect this two areas, but usability is always the most important.
                    </br>
                    As a psychologist & art historian, I am trying to connect psychological issues with design.
